🏡 Housing Market Trends Analysis

Descriptive Statistics, Regression, and Classification Using the Kaggle Housing Dataset
📄 Abstract

This project analyzes the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle to explore relationships between various property features and sale prices. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, regression modeling, and classification modeling to understand trends and make predictions. By focusing on both numerical and categorical variables, the project aims to demonstrate key concepts from a data science course with clear, interpretable methods.
📊 Project Summary

We apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the housing market. Specifically, we:

    Compute descriptive statistics for numerical features.

    Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices.

    Build a classification model to predict categorical attributes (e.g., HouseStyle).

This analysis serves as a foundational exercise in statistical reasoning, regression, and classification within a real-world dataset.
🧠 Objectives

    Descriptive Analysis: Calculate key statistics such as mean and standard deviation for selected variables (e.g., LotArea).

    Regression Modeling: Use multiple features like GrLivArea and OverallQual to predict SalePrice.

    Classification Modeling: Predict a categorical variable (e.g., HouseStyle) based on other house attributes.

🔍 Usefulness

    Reinforces core statistical and machine learning concepts in a real-world context.

    Offers interpretable results with clear links to mathematical foundations.

    Serves as a basis for more advanced modeling or exploratory data analysis.
